### Executive Summary

Using SQL, I pulled data on private companies with a valuation over $1 billion as of March 2022, including each company's current valuation, funding, country of origin, industry, select investors, and the years they were founded and became unicorns. 

I analyzed unicorn companies, uncovering insights on return on investment, time to achieve unicorn status, geographical distribution, and top investors.

The database I used was Teradata Vantage Express and the development environment was Teradata Studio.

### Key Questions

My analysis provided answers to these questions:

1. Which unicorn companies have had the biggest return on investment?
